            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>In Australia, pizza is a popular food and is available in different varieties. The Australians have preserved the originality of the Italian pizzas. At the same time they have also developed the Australian version of pizzas famous as Kenwick Dial-A-Pizza.
                At Kenwick Pizza, we are proud to say that we understand the Australian taste buds and we hold our heritage high. This is why we are always concerned about the ingredients of our pizzas. We always try to maintain the traditional Italian base of the pizzas. At the same time we also try to add the Australian flavour to our pizzas and for this we are renowned for at Kenwick Pizza.
                Same owners since 1986</p>
